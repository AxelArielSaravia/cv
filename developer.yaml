    About: >
      This is my own wrapper to compile C with the GCC compiler. The idea
      is to have a set of defaults (warnings, security, and standards) and
      a set of commands to simplify actions. You can compile at any time
      with different defaults, making it flexible and easy to adapt to
      various projects.
