About: >
    During my time at the university, I developed a strong foundation in
    contemporary music, studying a wide range of composers from Guillaume
    Machaut to Alexander Schubert. This versatility is evident in pieces like
    “Prelude in Antique Style”, a piano piece in post-romantic style, and
    “inSets”, a web-based generative interactive composition (insets-music.web.app/).
    As well, I have explored sound and collaborative composition techniques
    extensively, notably in “Pieza No. 305” with Hernan Escudero. From 2019 to
    2020, I served as an assistant in the music morphology course at the
    university. I have also made contributions to music theory, focusing on
    algorithmic music composition, generative music composition, and the
    application of information theory to music, which were highlighted in my
    thesis. I participated in several workshops, including Alicia Terzian's
    composition workshop (2016), Emile Girard Carest's cello workshop (2018),
    the Untref String Quartet workshop (2019), and an interview with Luis Maria
    Serra (2021).

    About:
      - I explore the concepts of Umberto Eco's "work in movement" and its relation to information theory, emphasizing the dynamic nature of art and its probabilistic structure. This approach frames art as a process of communication.
      - Generative compositions are described as works where some compositional decisions are made by an external agent.
      - The use of computers and algorithms in music composition is explored, highlighting how these tools enable the creation of generative works.
      - Practical example demonstrate how theoretical concepts are implemented in creating interactive and dynamic musical work.
